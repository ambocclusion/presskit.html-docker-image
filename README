## How to use
Create a new folder on your machine, and inside that folder create a `docker-compose.yml`, then put this inside:

`
version: "3.8"
services:
  presskit:
    image: ambocclusion/presskit.html
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - /path/on/host:/home/node/presskit/site
`

if you like command line better, run this in a terminal: `docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 --rm ambocclusion/presskit.html:latest -v /location/on/host/machine:/home/node/presskit/site`

If the location on host machine is empty, it'll create a new data setup to start using presskit right away!
